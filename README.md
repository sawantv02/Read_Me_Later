# Read_it_Later
Website building project with client and server side coding

Project Proposal:
Topic: ‘Read It Later’ Website
Description:
Most of the times we come across the webpage to read and due to lack of time we bookmark it and forget about it. Instead of bookmarking we can mark it as ‘Read It Later’ and store it in the online reading list.(Plugin can be provided for the browser.)
‘Read It Later’ website will provide the sign up access to the users. Users can view their contents marked for reading later. Content can be categorized as articles, videos, music, etc. Users can mark their content as ‘favorites’ and archive them. Also they can share the content to their friends by using email. They can check the content shared to them in their ‘Inbox’.
Website can also display the ‘Recommended’ content or the week’s chart for the most read items. 
Content storage will be limited to the particular number of uploads. If it exceeds certain limit, website will ask for paid account.

Roles:
1.	Users: Users are the account holders for the website. Website cannot be accessed without signing up.
2.	Admin: Admin will register the user and give them appropriate access rights.
3.	Content Manager: Content Manager will post the recommended content which will be shared to all the users. He is also responsible for posting ads to the websites.
